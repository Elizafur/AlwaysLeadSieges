Simple mod to make the player always lead sieges in Mount and Blade: Bannerlord, no more will a larger army come bully you away from leading and ruin your strategy.

Installation is the same as any other bannerlord mod.

This mod was inspired by this currently [out of date mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/5738)

This mod should fix some bugs associated with it's predecessor namely:
* The AI not building siege engines while defending against your siege.
* Crashing on victory when player is defending a siege (I hope, please test this for me)

Feel free to change this mod in anyway or fix it for future updates.
